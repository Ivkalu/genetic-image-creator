# GENETIC IMAGE RECREATOR

This repository showcases image recreation by genetic algorithm.
Code is roughly based on [following article](https://medium.com/@sebastian.charmot/genetic-algorithm-for-image-recreation-4ca546454aaa). So I advise reading it for deeper understanding.

### How to run

Create new env:

`
python3 -m venv venv
`

Activate:

`
source venv/bin/activate
`

Install requirements:

`
pip install -r requirements.txt
`

Run main.py, or change env variables in utils.py:

`
python3 main.py
`

### Fin Fun

Have fun seeing your image being recreated from scratch using poligons or circles! :-)
